The only problem I encountered is that `XCode` automatically jumps up to try to open the `.md` file. This was resolved by going into system preferences, file associations, and set the default app for `.md` to `RStudio` rather than `XCode`. \n\nNext questions:\n\n- [ ] how do I push this to my github site?\n\n- [ ] can I point my own URL to the github.io page?\n\n```{r}\nplot(1:10)\n```\n",
