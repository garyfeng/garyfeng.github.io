Getting ready to implement the image overlay in [plot.ly](http://garyfeng.github.io/2016/06/plot-ly-transparent-image-background-my-hacks.html). 

- Forked the main [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js)
- Forked the [plotly.py](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py)
- Forked the [R interface](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly)

Target is to implement the transparent image in plot_api.js, see example [gist](https://gist.github.com/garyfeng/9516714839c84a1982dda74dd5f14a6c). We will report back how it works.
