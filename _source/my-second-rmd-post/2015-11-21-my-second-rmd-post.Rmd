Well, I thought I disabled XCode from automatically popping up. It still does.

Secondly, this workflow automatically adds `/knitr-jekyll` before the URL for figures, resulting something like `/knitr-jekyllfigure/...`. This was done at the knitr from Rmd to md. It's in the md. 

Then I did some test, and changed the `baseurl: ""` to `baseurl: "/"` in `_config.yml`, the URL is fixed. But doing so would ruin the rest of the pages -- the "about" page becomes `http://about/`.

Now I am going back, and just have to manually do this.
