Following [this blog](http://brendanrocks.com/blogging-with-rmarkdown-knitr-jekyll/) it is straightforward to set up the jekyll site. The only problem I encountered is that `XCode` automatically jumps up to try to open the `.md` file. This was resolved by going into system preferences, file associations, and set the default app for `.md` to `RStudio` rather than `XCode`.

Next questions:

- [ ] how do I push this to my github site?

- [ ] can I point my own URL to the github.io page?
