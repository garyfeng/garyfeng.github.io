I began working with Processing in its original version, and still remember the disruption Processing 2 caused. But Loved the langauge and the approach. Also was watching processing.js with a hopeful eye. 

A few updates:

- Now [p5js](http://p5js.org/) has real promise -- but the mouse-art is really annoying.
- Processing is 3 now, and I need to update
- Processing has a [Python mode](http://py.processing.org/)
- Processing [libraries](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/) ... still not much more in CV and multimodal beyond what I saw a couple of years ago.
