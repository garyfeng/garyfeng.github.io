Ha, I have been using a [Python module](http://moderndata.plot.ly/color-scales-in-ipython-notebook/) inspired by Cynthia Brewer, the [colorlover](https://github.com/jackparmer/colorlover) module. I had to fix a couple of things with that module, though I can't recall what exactly I did. 

Here's the URL to her [original site](http://colorbrewer2.org/). Very cool and practical design. And the [background](http://www.personal.psu.edu/cab38/ColorBrewer/ColorBrewer_updates.html).
